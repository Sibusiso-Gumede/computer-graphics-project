# computer-graphics-project
A simple village: a university project developed using WebGL and ThreeJS which is part of my final year computer graphics module.

## Program Modules
|Name         |Purpose of the module                                              |  
|---|---|
|index        |The entry point to the application. It resolves <script></script>  |
|             |which references the JavaScript source code.|  
|run_script   |Integrates all the subroutines to initialise the scene objects.    |  
|subroutines  |Contains functions that modify the scene.                          |  
|subroutines2 |Contains functions used in the run_script module.                  |  

## How to Run the Program?
Open the index.html file and the browser will run the script. The WebGL engine, which is part of almost every browser,   
will then render the scene.
